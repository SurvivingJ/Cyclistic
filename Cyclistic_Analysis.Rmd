# Check for structural mismatches
compare_df_cols(dataframes, return = "mismatch")

# Combine all monthly CSVs
combined_df <- bind_rows(dataframes)
```

---

# 3. Data Cleaning

Data cleaning ensures completeness, consistent datatypes, and removal of invalid records. 
The following steps cover null assessment, duplication checks, categorical harmonization, duration filtering, outlier diagnostics, and geospatial validation.

```{r data_cleaning}
# Step 1: Assess Null Values
colSums(is.na(combined_df))
round(sapply(combined_df, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) * 100, 2)

# Step 2: Remove Duplicates
dupes <- get_dupes(combined_df)
combined_df <- distinct(combined_df)

# Step 3: Standardize Date-Time Fields
combined_df$started_at <- as_datetime(combined_df$started_at)
combined_df$ended_at <- as_datetime(combined_df$ended_at)

# Step 4: Filter Unusable Dates
start_range <- ymd("2024-09-01")
end_range   <- ymd("2025-09-30")
combined_df <- combined_df %>% filter(started_at >= start_range & started_at <= end_range)

# Step 5: Validate and Sanitize Categories
combined_df <- combined_df %>%
  mutate(
    rideable_type = str_to_lower(trimws(rideable_type)),
    member_casual = str_to_lower(trimws(member_casual))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    member_casual = recode(member_casual, "member" = "Member", "casual" = "Casual"),
    rideable_type = recode(rideable_type, "classic_bike" = "Classic Bike", "electric_bike" = "Electric Bike", "electric_scooter" = "Electric Scooter")
  )

# Step 6: Calculate Trip Durations
combined_df <- combined_df %>%
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(ended_at - started_at)) %>%
  filter(duration >= 60 & duration <= 86400)

# Step 7: Drop Incomplete Data
combined_df <- combined_df %>% remove_empty(which = c("rows", "cols")) %>% drop_na()

# Step 8: Enhance Features - Add Weekday
combined_df <- combined_df %>% mutate(day_of_the_week = weekdays(as.Date(started_at)))

# Step 9: Outlier Detection
find_outliers <- function(x) {
  q1 <- quantile(x, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
  q3 <- quantile(x, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE)
  iqr <- q3 - q1
  lower <- q1 - 1.5 * iqr
  upper <- q3 + 1.5 * iqr
  return(x < lower | x > upper)
}

outliers_df <- combined_df %>% filter(find_outliers(duration))

# Step 10: Validate Geographic Accuracy
combined_df <- combined_df %>%
  filter(
    between(start_lat, 41.4, 42.3),
    between(start_lng, -88.3, -87.3),
    between(end_lat, 41.4, 42.3),
    between(end_lng, -88.3, -87.3)
  )

# Step 11: Add Month and Season Columns
combined_df <- combined_df %>%
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(started_at, label = TRUE),
         season = case_when(
           month %in% c("Dec", "Jan", "Feb") ~ "Winter",
           month %in% c("Mar", "Apr", "May") ~ "Spring",
           month %in% c("Jun", "Jul", "Aug") ~ "Summer",
           month %in% c("Sep", "Oct", "Nov") ~ "Fall"
         ))
```

# 4. Analysis

## Executive Insights

Cyclistic’s data shows that members are the backbone of the system, accounting for nearly two-thirds of rides, with classic bikes and short trips driving the largest volumes. Member traffic peaks during the workweek and typical commuting hours, while casual users are most active on weekends and afternoons, indicating leisure-driven behavior. Classic bikes comprise over half of all trips, electric bikes roughly 43%, and scooters less than 2%, reflecting product availability and user preferences. The data demonstrates clear trends in usage by day, hour, duration, and season, all influenced by Chicago’s weather and urban rhythms. To increase annual memberships, marketing should target frequent casual users, promote the cost and convenience of short commutes, and consider referral or loyalty programs.

***

## User Type Breakdown

```{r user-type-table}
combined_df %>%
  count(member_casual) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * n / sum(n), 2)) %>%
  reactable(theme = teal_reactable_theme)
```

#### Insight
Nearly 64% of all trips are made by members (with 36% by casual riders), confirming the importance of retaining and growing this segment for profitability. Understanding unique user counts and their ride frequency would further inform strategies for expansion.

***

## Bike Type by User Category

```{r bike-type}
combined_df %>%
  count(rideable_type, member_casual) %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * n / sum(n), 2)) %>%
  reactable(theme = teal_reactable_theme)
```

#### Insight
Classic bikes account for around 55% of usage in both groups, with electric bikes close behind at 43%. Scooters comprise only 1% of trips, likely a consequence of limited fleet presence rather than demand.

***

## Trip Duration Summary

```{r duration-summary}
combined_df %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(
    Min = round(min(duration / 60, na.rm=TRUE),2),
    Q1 = round(quantile(duration / 60, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE),2),
    Median = round(median(duration / 60, na.rm=TRUE),2),
    Mean = round(mean(duration / 60, na.rm=TRUE),2),
    Q3 = round(quantile(duration / 60, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE),2),
    Max = round(max(duration / 60, na.rm=TRUE),2)
  ) %>%
  reactable(theme = teal_reactable_theme)
```

#### Insight
Members take short trips (mean: 12.2 min), while casual rides average 24.3 minutes, supporting a split between utilitarian commuting and recreational use. Over half of member rides are under 10 minutes.

***

## Rides by Day of Week

```{r day-of-week}
day_df <- combined_df %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  count(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  mutate(percent = 100 * n / sum(n))

ggplot(day_df, aes(x = day_of_week, y = percent, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Member" = "#43939A", "Casual" = "#E8F238")) +
  labs(title = "Rides by Day of Week", x = "Day", y = "Percent within User Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Insight
Members ride most often on weekdays, whereas casual usage is concentrated from Friday to Sunday, which aligns with patterns of work commutes versus recreational or social outings.

***

## Rides by Hour of Day

```{r hourly-usage}
hour_df <- combined_df %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(started_at)) %>%
  count(member_casual, hour) %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  mutate(percent = 100 * n / sum(n))

ggplot(hour_df, aes(x = hour, y = percent, color = member_casual)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.1) +
  labs(title = "Hourly Bike Usage", x = "Hour", y = "Percent within Group") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Member" = "#43939A", "Casual" = "#E8F238")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Insight
Members peak during rush hours (early morning, late afternoon), matching regular commuter schedules. Casual riders show their highest activity during afternoons and weekends, indicating leisurely rides and outings.

***

## Duration Bucket Analysis

```{r duration-buckets}
combined_df <- combined_df %>%
  mutate(duration_mins = duration / 60,
         duration_bucket = cut(duration_mins,
            breaks = c(0,10,20,30,60,90,120,180,Inf),
            labels = c("0-10","11-20","21-30","31-60","61-90","91-120","121-180","180+"),
            right=TRUE, include.lowest=TRUE))

duration_summary <- combined_df %>%
  count(member_casual, duration_bucket) %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  mutate(percent = 100 * n / sum(n))

ggplot(duration_summary, aes(x = duration_bucket, y = percent, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Member" = "#43939A","Casual" = "#E8F238")) +
  labs(title = "Trip Duration Distribution by User Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Insight
Almost 57% of member rides are brief (under 10 minutes), compared with 38% for casual users. Casual riders favor longer, single-rental journeys. Members display comfort using bikes for quick, spontaneous trips.

***

## Seasonality by Month

```{r seasonality}
ggplot(combined_df, aes(x = month, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Member" = "#43939A", "Casual" = "#E8F238")) +
  labs(title = "Monthly Bike Usage by User Type", x = "Month", y = "Ride Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Insight
Winter months sharply reduce ridership due to adverse weather; peak activity occurs in summer and early fall. September sees a strong spike, worth further review in multi-year trend analysis.
